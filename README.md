# BSA_simulation
Simulation of bulk segregant analysis - control vs selected large pools of recombinant inbred individuals

Acknowledgements: I initially developed simulations using the Hypred software in R by Frank Technow (http://finzi.psych.upenn.edu/library/hypred/html/hypred-package.html), but when it was not supported with updated versions of R I re-wrote the simulations in python to be faster. The code is all my own, but some of the conceptual thinking about how to do the simulation is drawn from Hypred.
